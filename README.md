## 🚀 Overview

**QUERYLYTIC** is an open, extensible platform that lets anyone — startups, teams, or enterprises — connect their databases and **query data using natural language**.
No SQL required. Just ask, and QUERYLYTIC turns your question into answers, charts, and live dashboards.

Whether your data lives in **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, **CSV**, or **Excel files**, QUERYLYTIC connects to it securely and lets you explore it conversationally.

## 💡 What It Does

* **🔗 Connect any data source**
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, CSV, Excel — or extend it with new connectors using the registry microservice system.

* **💬 Ask questions in plain English**
“What were the sales last quarter?” → instantly translated into an optimized query.

* **📊 Auto-generated visualizations**
QUERYLYTIC intelligently suggests the best chart (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.) based on your data type.

* **🧩 Build dashboards from chat**
Pick charts from your conversation and turn them into live dashboards you can share or revisit later.

* **👥 Team-based collaboration**
Manage organizations, projects, roles, and permissions to keep workspaces structured and secure.

* **🔐 Secure by design**
End-to-end encryption for connector credentials, granular access control, and audit logging.
